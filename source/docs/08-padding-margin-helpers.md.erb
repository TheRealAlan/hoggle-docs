title: Padding & Margin Helpers
---

Padding and margin can be added with classes that are multiples of `$base` up to 6, which by default are 6px. For example, `.pad-3` would result in 18px of padding on all four sides. There are separate classes for direction as well. For top and bottom, `.pad-v-*`, and for left and right, `.pad-h-*`. Add padding to just one side using `.pad-top-*`, `.pad-right-*`, `.pad-bottom-*`, and `.pad-left-*`.
