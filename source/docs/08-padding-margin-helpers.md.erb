title: Padding & Margin Helpers
---

Padding and margin can be added with classes that are multiples of `$base` up to 6, which by default are 6px. For example, `.p-3` would result in 18px of padding on all four sides. There are separate classes for direction as well. For top and bottom, `.pv-*`, and for left and right, `.ph-*`. Add padding to just one side using `.pt-*`, `.pr-*`, `.pb-*`, and `.pl-*`.
