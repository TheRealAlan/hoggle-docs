title: Columns
---

Columns are wrapped in a `.row` class. Rows can be wrapped in a `.container` class to limit and center the width of the columns to the maximum column width for the screen size.

Columns are defined with the class `.col` and any combination of classes determining the width at different screen sizes. By default, these are `.x-small-*`, `.small-*`, `.medium-*`, `.large-*`, and `.x-large-*`. This means the column will fill the column space from the specified screen size up. Different column sizes can be set for different screen sizes.

The default breakpoints are set as follows:

``` scss
$x_small: 0px;
$small: 480px;
$medium: 768px;
$large: 992px;
$x_large: 1200px;
```

The `.col` width is determined by the suffix of the class names. The default available sizes are halves, thirds, quarters, and eighths.
